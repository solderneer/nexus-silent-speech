# Nexus, a session-indepedennt silent speech interface
A novel approach to session-independent silent speech recognition systems with a multiplexed star electrode array, developed for my final year dissertation at University College London (UCL). Includes datasets, code, and electronics CAD files.

## Overview
This repository houses my final year dissertation project at University College London (UCL), focused on developing a novel multiplexed star electrode array to address the challenges of cross-session variability in silent speech recognition systems. This innovative approach leverages configurable electrode orientations to significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, leading to improved recognition accuracy across sessions.

## Project Objectives
- To investigate the impact of cross-session variability on the accuracy of silent speech recognition systems.
- To design, develop, and evaluate a multiplexed star electrode array capable of adjusting electrode orientations for optimal muscle-electrode alignment.
- To compare the performance of the novel star electrode array against traditional electrode configurations in terms of SNR and silent speech recognition accuracy.

## Results Summary
The project successfully demonstrated the potential of the star electrode array to achieve superior muscle-electrode alignment, resulting in a significant increase in SNR compared to control configurations. Most notably, the array displayed a remarkable 41% relative improvement in cross-session classification accuracy, underscoring its effectiveness in mitigating the challenges posed by session-dependent variability.
